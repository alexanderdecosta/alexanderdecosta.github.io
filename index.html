    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I'm a machine learning engineer focused on building scalable, well-engineered systems grounded in cutting-edge models. What sets me apart is a deep mathematical foundation — especially in probability, functional analysis, and numerical methods — that I use to design ML solutions with rigor and robustness.
    </p>
    <p>
      My current focus is turning modern ML research into practical APIs, with an emphasis on clarity, modularity, and production-readiness.

    <h2>Current Project</h2>
    <h3>Gaussian Process Regression API (Ongoing)</h3>
    <p>
      I'm developing a FastAPI-based service implementing Gaussian Process Regression via GPyTorch. This system produces probabilistic predictions with quantified uncertainty, useful in high-stakes fields like finance and healthcare. It's designed with modular components for flexible kernel choices, strong performance, and seamless integration into production ML pipelines.

    <h2>Mathematical Interests</h2>
    <p>
      I’m especially interested in how advanced mathematics can enhance ML system design. My current focus is on functional analysis, high-dimensional probability, and numerical methods — tools that inform areas like kernel methods, Gaussian processes, and stability in learning systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      These interests aren’t academic luxuries; they enable a deeper understanding of how modern ML algorithms work. This insight not only shapes the way I build systems, but also leads to more powerful, principled models. My goal is to apply mathematically grounded methods to real-world ML challenges, balancing deep theory with practical engineering.
