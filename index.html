    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I build modular, production-ready machine learning systems that deliver consistent, explainable results even with complex or changing data. By combining deep mathematical insight with practical engineering, I help businesses transform data into confident decisions—minimizing guesswork through principled, data-driven approaches.
