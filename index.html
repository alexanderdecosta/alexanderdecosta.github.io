    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I'm a machine learning engineer focused on building scalable, well-engineered systems grounded in cutting-edge models. What sets me apart is a deep mathematical foundation — especially in probability, functional analysis, and numerical methods — that I use to design ML solutions with rigor and robustness.
    </p>
    <p>
      My current focus is turning modern ML research into practical APIs, with an emphasis on clarity, modularity, and production-readiness.

  <h2>Current Project</h2>
  <h3>Scalable Energy Forecasting API (Ongoing)</h3>
  <p>
    Building a full-scale, production-ready API using FastAPI for energy demand forecasting. Implementing scalable Gaussian Process Regression models from first principles to handle large datasets, with custom kernel design and inference optimization. Benchmarked against standard models (e.g., XGBoost, ARIMA) with focus on uncertainty quantification, modularity, and deployment readiness.

    <h2>Mathematical Interests</h2>
    <p>
      I’m especially interested in how advanced mathematics can enhance ML system design. My current focus is on functional analysis, high-dimensional probability, and numerical methods — tools that inform areas like kernel methods, Gaussian processes, and stability in learning systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      These interests aren’t academic luxuries; they enable a deeper understanding of how modern ML algorithms work. This insight not only shapes the way I build systems, but also leads to more powerful, principled models. My goal is to apply mathematically grounded methods to real-world ML challenges, balancing deep theory with practical engineering.
