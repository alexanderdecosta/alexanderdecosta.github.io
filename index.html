    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am a machine learning engineer with a strong foundation in mathematics and probability. I build interpretable, production-ready AI systems by combining probabilistic reasoning, forecasting, and deep learning, working end-to-end from model design to deployment.
    </p>

    <h2>Work at RiskScope</h2>
    <h3>Co-founder & Lead ML Consultant (2025â€“Present)</h3>
    <p>
      RiskScope delivers tailored machine learning solutions for organizations requiring reliable forecasting, risk modeling, and decision intelligence.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Design hybrid deep probabilistic models combining deep learning and Bayesian methods for forecasting and risk analysis.</li>
      <li>Benchmark custom pipelines against state-of-the-art architectures such as LSTMs, Transformers, and Temporal Fusion Transformers.</li>
      <li>Build scalable systems integrating classical time series models with modern deep learning tools.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>What I Work On</h2>
    <p>
      I focus on developing interpretable, robust machine learning systems where uncertainty and reliability are critical. My expertise includes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Probabilistic modeling: Gaussian Processes, Bayesian neural networks, hierarchical models</li>
      <li>Deep learning: Transformers, LSTMs, GANs, diffusion models</li>
      <li>Time series forecasting: state-space models and hybrid pipelines</li>
      <li>Scalable engineering: PyTorch, scikit-learn, FastAPI, Docker, cloud deployment (in progress)</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Mathematical Interests</h2>
    <p>
      My background in spectral theory, functional analysis, and stochastic processes informs the models I build, especially in high-stakes environments where interpretability and uncertainty quantification are essential.
    </p>
    <p>
      This foundation guides my design of algorithms that are both theoretically sound and practical for production use.
