  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    Machine learning engineer passionate about turning complex challenges into scalable, production-ready solutions. Grounded in solid mathematical principles and practical engineering, I focus on building reliable systems that drive real impact.

  <h2>Current Project</h2>
  <h3>Scalable Energy Forecasting API (Ongoing)</h3>
  <p>
    Building a full-scale, production-ready API using FastAPI for energy demand forecasting. Implementing scalable Gaussian Process Regression models from first principles to handle large datasets, with custom kernel design and inference optimization. Benchmarked against standard models (e.g., XGBoost, ARIMA) with focus on uncertainty quantification, modularity, and deployment readiness.

  <h2>Mathematical Interests</h2>
  <p>
    Iâ€™m especially interested in how advanced mathematics can enhance many parts of the ML pipeline. My focus on functional analysis, probability theory, and numerical methods informs not only the design of core algorithms like kernel methods and Gaussian processes but also optimization, uncertainty quantification, and model robustness.
  </p>
  <p>
    These tools deepen my understanding of how models learn and behave, guiding me to build systems that are both principled and effective from research through deployment.
