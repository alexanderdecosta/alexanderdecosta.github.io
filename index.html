    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I'm a machine learning engineer with a strong foundation in mathematics and probability, focused on building interpretable, production-ready AI systems. I work across the stack—from model design to implementation—with a focus on probabilistic reasoning, forecasting, and deep learning.
    </p>

    <h2>Work at RiskScope</h2>
    <h3>Co-founder & Lead ML Consultant (2025–Present)</h3>
    <p>
      RiskScope delivers tailored machine learning solutions for organizations requiring reliable forecasting, risk modeling, and decision intelligence.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Designing hybrid deep probabilistic models (e.g., LSTM-GP, TFT-Bayes) for forecasting and risk modeling.</li>
      <li>Benchmarking custom pipelines against state-of-the-art architectures including LSTMs, Transformers, and Temporal Fusion Transformers.</li>
      <li>Building scalable systems that combine Bayesian methods, classical time series models, and modern deep learning tools.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>What I Work On</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Probabilistic modeling: Gaussian Processes, Bayesian NNs, hierarchical models</li>
      <li>Deep learning: Transformers, LSTMs, GANs, diffusion models, deep GPs</li>
      <li>Forecasting: time series models, state-space systems, hybrid pipelines</li>
      <li>Mathematics for ML: spectral theory, functional analysis, high-dimensional probability</li>
      <li>Engineering tools: PyTorch, scikit-learn, FastAPI, Docker, cloud deployment (in progress)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Mathematical Interests</h2>
    <p>
      I work at the intersection of mathematics and machine learning. My background in spectral theory, functional analysis, and stochastic processes shapes the design and behavior of the models I build, especially in high-stakes settings where uncertainty and interpretability matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      This focus allows me to design algorithms that are theoretically sound, robust in practice, and grounded in first principles.
